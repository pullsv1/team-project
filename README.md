We have a discord (created by isaac) https://discord.gg/WrFtCbe which is for us to communicate ideas as a hub next to ours.

I also noticed that we have not had a meeting yet to see where everyone is at in terms of comfort with the use of GIT and whom wants to write what. Also we have not had a discussion on how our team will use discord, etc.
